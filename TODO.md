# TODO LIST FOR NIXOS CONFIG

In no particular order,

- Further configure GNOME
    - Remove unnecessary & redundant software (Tour, Music, etc.)
    - Configure Dash icons
    - Custom keybinds
    - Other remaining GNOME settings not yet covered
- Configure software
    - I know that Amberol and Celluloid can have their configurations altered... figure out how that works
- Modularize nixos-config directory
- Experiment with new software
  - New shell (zsh or fish?)
  - Rust-based utilities (See NoBoilerPlate video)
